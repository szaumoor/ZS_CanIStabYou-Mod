# Introduction
### Can I stab you?

That's the million-dollar question for every character who can backstab.

This mod addresses in a very modular way your preferences as far as who gets to be immune to backstabs. It's a common complaint to not be able to backstab many enemies, including many in ToB, which reduces the already underpowered (and seemingly hated by the game) Thieves, where backstabs is one of the main and sometimes only way of excelling in combat. They will always be outplayed by Fighters and other classes that can be "left alone to do their thing in combat" without micromanagement.

There's a group to remove backstab immunities to particular groups or specific enemies, and a group to enforce this immunity as per your liking.

# Components

### Backstab Immunity: Removals

**Component 99:** Everything can be backstabbed

Exactly as it says. This component is mutually exclusive with the rest of components in this group since it covers everything already.

**Component 106:** All humanoids can be backstabbed, except ToB bosses

This component makes every humanoid immune to backstab susceptible again except humanoid ToB bosses (Sendai, Balthazar, Gromnir, Melissan). It includes humanoids such as Kiser, the humanoid helpers of Yaga Shura, and the tiefling servants of Aesgareth who are inexplicably immune to backstabs (probably Bioware's way of giving the middle finger to Thieves -- especially pure thieves -- since they have this type of seething hate for them).

**Component 102:** Humanoid ToB bosses can be backstabbed

This ensures that Sendai, Balthazar, Amelyssan, and Gromnir can be backstabbed. Bear in mind that end-of-install-order mods like SCS make Gromnir a barbarian and therefore automatically immune to backstabs.

**Component 103:** Yaga-Shura can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 112:** Sendai can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 122:** Balthazar can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 113:** Abazigal can be backstabbed (human form)

Self explanatory.

**Component 114:** Abazigal can be backstabbed (dragon form)

Self explanatory.

**Component 105:** Amelyssan can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 121:** Bhaal's avatars can be backstabbed

This makes all instances of Slayer and The Ravager no longer immune to backstab. The ravager takes almost no damage from anything anyway.

**Component 100:** Beholders can be backstabbed

You know what's a weak point? THAT GIANT FRICKING EYEBALL. Beholders are no longer immune to backstabs. Climb on that thing and stab that damn eyeball. Legolas would be proud.

**Component 115:** Celestials such as Planetars, Devas, and Solars can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 117:** Demogorgon can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 116:** Demons and devils can be backstabbed (except Demogorgon)

Self explanatory. This also includes Aesgareth and other special demons in WK.

**Component 109:** Demiliches can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 110:** Dragons can be backstabbed

I'm ambivalent about this one, although I'd pick it for mod setups that beef up dragon's health pool or damage resistances.

**Component 101:** Golems can be backstabbed

This ensures no golems are immune to backstabs (please give me structural weaknesses!). This affects creatures that are considered golems, like animated armor.

These creatures aren't actually immune in vanilla except adamantine golems, but they generally have outrageous physical resistances or outright immunities unless you have the right type of damage. For example, if you want to backstab a clay golem, you better have a club ready, only crushing does damage!

**Component 104:** Minotaurs can be backstabbed

This includes those stupid minotaurs in WK who have been granted the gift of ignoring blades going through their backs.

**Component 118:** Liches can be backstabbed

This includes the few liches with this immunity in ToB, and whatever other liches that might have this immunity.

**Component 108:** Slimes can be backstabbed

This doesn't make much logical sense, probably, since it's like stabbing soup, but there you go.

**Component 120:** Mist creatures can be backstabbed

In vanilla game mist creatures, including undead vampiric mists, and spellhaunts, are immune to backstab, and are as far as I know the only undead creatures that are. This removes this immunity.

### Backstab Immunity: Enforcement

**Component 201:** All spectral undead are immune to backstab

This includes shadows, spectres, wraiths, spectral trolls, and undead mist creatures such as vampiric mists.

**Component 205:** All golems are immune to backstab

AFAIK only the adamantine golem is immune to backstab in vanilla. This will make them all immune. This also includes Battle Horrors, and statues, which are also considered golems.

## Compatibility and issues

Bear in mind that in game versions previous to 2.6, creatures with invisibility detection via script (balors, dragons) can't be backstabbed either, as it is implied that because they can see through invisibility, your character is as far as they're concerned effectively not invisible and cannot backstab them. In 2.6+, more control is available, and only those that have the backstab immunity opcode are indeed immune.

This means that in versions < 2.6, these components will no open those enemies to backstabs just with the backstab immunity removal components. I might add add components in the future for invisibility detection via script removals.

### Can I stab you?

That's the million-dollar question for every character who can backstab.

This mod addresses in a very modular way your preferences as far as who gets to be immune to backstabs. It's a common complaint that we don't get to backstab many enemies, including many in ToB, which reduces the already underpowered (and seemingly hated by Bioware) Thieves (especially single-classed), where backstabs are one of the main and sometimes **only** way of excelling and contributing majorly in combat. They will generally be outplayed by Fighters and other classes that can be "left alone to do their thing in combat" without micromanagement. Micromanagement should pay off more than it does.

There's a group of components to remove backstab immunities from particular types or specific enemies, and a group to enforce this immunity as per your liking.

### What is a backstab?

There seems to be **schools of thought** around what a backstab should be. A backstab should be either:

- **(A)** Similar to a critical hit, it's just a hit that is dealt on a weak point -- or any other point that hurts and damages badly or causes important structural damage to the creature.
- **(B)** Unlike a critical hit, it's not about weak points, but about attacking by surprise or otherwise without seeing it coming, and the surprise is what makes the hit they take so powerful.
- **(C)** It's both, it's surprise attack that hits a weak point that otherwise would be difficult to hit if the creature was completely aware of your existence.
- **(D)** It doesn't matter and I don't care, I just want Thieves to be f***ing useful. Everything can be backstabbed, so shut up.

Followers of school of thoughts (A) would argue that if a creature has weak points or structural weaknesses, backstabs are fair game, regardless. So a celestial with higher awareness can be backstabbed, because it has a body with parts that can be damaged independently -- some of them being more important than others. Golems are fair game too because there are constructs that can have chips on their armor, but things like slimes and phantasmal creatures would not apply.

Followers of school of thought (B) would argue that if a creature has higher awareness, such as a celestial being or a demon, they wouldn't be able to be backstabbed, but other things that can be surprised are fair game.

Followers of school of thought (C) would argue that if a creature has either higher awareness or no weak points, they cannot be backstabbed under any circumstance, for the same reason critical hits are impossible.

And followers of school of thought (D) are just sick of Thieves being useless and just want to have fun with engaging gameplay regardless of whether it makes earthly sense or is lorewise accurate in some version of the setting.

I personally follow the school of thought (A): similar to sneak attacks, if a creature has a non-amorphous, completely physical body, then it can be backstabbed, even if it has higher awareness and can't be made unaware of your existence through invisibility. If they are distracted, they can be considered unaware in the sense that they may be dealing with something else, like another enemy fighting it or otherwise distracted. I resent the idea that seeing the invisible implies that they cannot be backstabbed, and I think it's cheesy and  implemented poorly.

**What is your school of thought?**

# Components

### Backstab Immunity: Removals

**Component 99:** Everything can be backstabbed

Exactly as it says. This component is mutually exclusive with the rest of components in this group since it covers everything already.

It will also affect non-usable items that are used to grant immunities to particular creatures, such as golem weapons, dragon rings, shaman spirit rings, etcetera. This patching is manual, if a mod introduces a new item for this purpose, it will not be patched. Compatibility can be added if I become aware of it though.

**Component 106:** All humanoids can be backstabbed, except ToB bosses

This component makes every humanoid immune to backstab susceptible again except humanoid ToB bosses (Sendai, Balthazar, Gromnir, Melissan). It includes humanoids such as Kiser in Saradush, the humanoid helpers of Yaga Shura, and the tiefling servants of Aesgareth who are inexplicably immune to backstabs (another middle finger to Thieves -- what in the world is so special about these tieflings?!).

**Component 102:** Humanoid ToB bosses can be backstabbed

This ensures that Sendai, Balthazar, Amelyssan, and Gromnir can be backstabbed. Bear in mind that end-of-install-order mods like SCS make Gromnir a barbarian and therefore automatically immune to backstabs.

**Component 107:** Gromnir can be backstabbed

He's just... a half-orc fighter.

**Component 103:** Yaga-Shura can be backstabbed

Yaga Shura is just a fire giant with an attitude. If regular giants can be backstabbed, Yaga-Shura can too.

**Component 112:** Sendai can be backstabbed

She's just... a drow cleric/mage...

**Component 122:** Balthazar can be backstabbed

He's just... a human monk...

**Component 113:** Abazigal can be backstabbed (human form)

This is separate from the humanoid tweak because even in his human form, he is considered a dragon nevertheless, and it probably doesn't make sense to treat this as an actual humanoid.

**Component 114:** Abazigal can be backstabbed (dragon form)

Self explanatory.

**Component 105:** Amelyssan can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 121:** Bhaal's avatars can be backstabbed

This makes all instances of Slayer and The Ravager no longer immune to backstab. The ravager takes almost no damage from anything anyway.

**Component 100:** Beholders can be backstabbed

You know what's a weak point? THAT GIANT FRICKING EYEBALL. Beholders are no longer immune to backstabs. Climb on that thing and stab that damn eyeball. Legolas would be proud.

**Component 115:** Celestials such as Planetars, Devas, and Solars can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 117:** Demogorgon can be backstabbed

Self explanatory.

**Component 116:** Demons and devils can be backstabbed (except Demogorgon)

This includes every creature marked as demonic. This also includes Aesgareth and other special demons in Watcher's Keep.

**Component 109:** Demiliches can be backstabbed

They're considered immune in the base game, probably because they're almost beyond the ties to the physical world, as per the lore, unlike liches, although they already have insane physical resistances, so it probably makes little difference. If anything, it will make Thieves slightly more useful in the fight on par with Fighters.

**Component 110:** Dragons can be backstabbed

I'm ambivalent about this one, although I'd pick it for mod setups that beef up dragon's health pool or damage resistances.

**Component 101:** Golems can be backstabbed

This ensures no golems are immune to backstabs (please give me structural weaknesses!). This affects creatures that are considered golems, like animated armor.

All golems are immune to backstab, either through effects on their creature file, or on their weapons assigned to them. This removes this immunity if it exists from both. Be warned that if new golems are introduced through mods, and there are new items that do this, this component will not patch them. Compatibility can be added if I become aware of it though.

**Component 104:** Minotaurs can be backstabbed

This includes those stupid minotaurs in Watcher's Keep, who have been granted the gift of ignoring blades going through their backs.

**Component 118:** Liches can be backstabbed

This includes the few liches with this immunity in ToB, and whatever other liches that might have this immunity.

**Component 108:** Slimes can be backstabbed

This doesn't make much logical sense, probably, since it's like stabbing soup, but there you go.

**Component 120:** Mist creatures can be backstabbed

In vanilla game mist creatures, including undead vampiric mists, and spellhaunts, are immune to backstab, and are as far as I know the only undead creatures that are. This removes this immunity.

### Backstab Immunity: Enforcement

**Component 201:** All spectral undead are immune to backstab

This includes shadows, spectres, wraiths, spectral trolls, and undead mist creatures such as vampiric mists.

**Component 205:** All golems are immune to backstab

This will ensure all golems are immune. Even though they normally are, if any of them is missing this immunity, it will be added. This component also includes Battle Horrors, and statues, which are also considered golems as far as race is concerned.

### Invisibility Detection: Removals

**Component 300:** Every creature marked as able to see through invisibility is automatically immune to backstabs (version 2.6+)

Creatures before game version 2.6 are automatically immune to backstabs, the logic being that if they can see through invisibility, the backstabs cannot trigger as you are effectively not invisible as far as they're concerned. This ensures any creatures marked as able to see through invisibility are immune to backstab if playing in game versions 2.6+, where the previously mentioned behavior is not present.

**Component 301:** No creature can see through invisibility, they must rely on invisibility dispelling like any other

This removes the ability to see through invisibility completely from the game, at least from creatures initially set up to be able to do that.

**Component 302:** Dragons cannot see through invisibility, except Abazigal

**Component 303:** Demons cannot see through invisibility, except Demogorgon

**Component 304:** Celestials cannot see through invisibility

**Component 305:** Liches cannot see through invisibility

**Component 306:** Demiliches cannot see through invisibility

**Component 307:** The Unseeing Eye cannot see through invisibility

**Component 308:** Sendai cannot see through invisibility

**Component 309:** Balthazar cannot see through invisibility

**Component 310:** Yaga-Shura cannot see through invisibility

**Component 311:** Amelyssan cannot see through invisibility

**Component 312:** Abazigal cannot see through invisibility

**Component 313:** Demogorgon cannot see through invisibility

**Component 314:** Bhaal's avatars cannot see through invisibility

## Compatibility and issues

This mod should ideally be installed after any mod that adds new creatures, or modify existing creatures. This will ensure it will work as expected. This also means you probably should install it after SCS, since my mod will process creatures as they are up to that point, and I'm fairly certain SCS adds new creatures (and certainly modifies existing ones).

Bear in mind that in game versions previous to 2.6, creatures with invisibility detection via script (balors, dragons) can't be backstabbed either, as it is implied that because they can see through invisibility, your character is as far as they're concerned effectively not invisible and thus you cannot backstab them. Personally, I think it's not quite logical. Higher awareness doesn't mean it's impossible to be distracted and therefore susceptible to a big surprise hit. In the end it's just a poorly implemented feature as far as I'm concerned.

In 2.6+, more control is available, and only those that have the backstab immunity opcode are indeed immune. This means that in versions < 2.6, these components will not open those enemies to backstabs just with the backstab immunity removal components and thus invisibility detection via script must be removed too.

I might add components in the future for critical hit immunity for the benefit of those who see backstabs and critical hits as essentially equivalent in terms of what gets affected by critical hits and backstabs.
